## Engine-Specific Discovery

- **Claude Code**: `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` thin wrappers are auto-generated at init time from `agents/skills/` frontmatter. Regenerate with: `bash scripts/utils/generate-engine.sh --engine claude`
- **Codex**: Read `agents/skills/` directly (no wrapper layer)
- **Other engines**: Read this file for the catalog, then load skill content from the paths above
