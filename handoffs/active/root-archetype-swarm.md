# Root-Archetype: Swarm Coordination Architecture

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Summary

Created the `root-archetype` repository — a project-agnostic template for seeding governance root repos with built-in multi-agent swarm coordination. Inspired by Karpathy's agenthub, adapted for governed, single-machine, inference-bottlenecked environments.

## Repository

- **Location**: `/mnt/raid0/llm/root-archetype`
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/pestopoppa/root-archetype
- **Commits**: 4 (initial scaffold + cost policy + twyne-root port + contamination fix)
- **Files**: 52 files, ~4400 LOC

## What's Built

### Governance Primitives (synthesized from epyc-root + twyne-root)
- 11 hooks spanning 6 events (SessionStart, SessionEnd, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, SubagentStart)
- 2 validators (agent structure, references)
- 3 example agent roles (lead-developer, research-engineer, safety-reviewer)
- Shared policy (operating constraints, engineering standards, workflows)
- Agent logging (JSONL audit trail + analyzer)
- Session management (init, health check)
- Cost optimization policy (model tier routing, context compaction, budget controls)

### Swarm Coordination Primitive
- **Coordinator** (`swarm/coordinator.py`, ~500 LOC): SQLite-backed with WAL mode
  - Agent registration + heartbeat + stale-claim release
  - Priority work queue (not FIFO)
  - Message board (channels + threaded posts)
  - Resource locks with TTL
  - Budget enforcement per agent with ledger
- **Experiment Scheduler** (`swarm/scheduler.py`, ~300 LOC):
  - ParetoArchive with hypervolume tracking (2D exact, >2D Monte Carlo)
  - Expected Improvement scoring: frontier distance, novelty, species diversity, uncertainty
  - Re-scores all pending experiments after each validation
  - Species effectiveness tracking for MetaOptimizer feedback
- **Swarm Client** (`swarm/client.py`, ~200 LOC):
  - Thin agent library with context manager
  - Auto-heartbeat thread
  - Lock tracking and cleanup on exit

### Infrastructure
- `init-project.sh` — Seed new projects from archetype with variable substitution
- Child repo management: register, scan-agents, sync, add-dependency
- Nightshift swarm scheduler: run_wrapper.sh with --swarm flag, inference guard, nightshift.yaml
- Claude Code integration: /swarm command, settings.json, skill definition

## GitHub Issues (Work Backlog)

1. [#1 Governance Synthesis](https://github.com/pestopoppa/root-archetype/issues/1) — Complete remaining governance ports
2. [#2 Swarm Hardening](https://github.com/pestopoppa/root-archetype/issues/2) — Testing, edge cases, HTTP API
3. [#3 AutoPilot as Swarm Consumer](https://github.com/pestopoppa/root-archetype/issues/3) — Restructure AutoPilot to use swarm
4. [#4 Nightshift as Swarm Scheduler](https://github.com/pestopoppa/root-archetype/issues/4) — Full swarm-mode nightshift

## Key Design Decisions

1. **SQLite-first coordinator** — No HTTP server. WAL mode handles concurrent agent access on shared filesystem.
2. **Priority queue, not FIFO** — Experiment scheduler maximizes Pareto frontier information per unit of inference time.
3. **Dumb coordinator, smart agents** — Coordinator stores data and enforces constraints. Agents make scoring decisions.
4. **Worktree isolation** — Each swarm agent gets its own git worktree. Governance hooks apply per-worktree.
5. **Umbrella PR for nightshift** — Single consolidated report per run, not N individual PRs. Risk-tiered merge policy.
6. **Cost optimization as primitive** — Model tier routing, context compaction, budget controls ship with the archetype.

### Twyne-Root Patterns Ported
- Session lifecycle hooks (start/end with identity, branch, facts cache)
- Pre-edit guard (secret scanning + log isolation + config tamper-proofing)
- Correction detection (UserPromptSubmit → agent file gap assessment)
- Ripple detection (PostToolUse → dependency map downstream warnings)
- Write-time linting (PostToolUse → repo-toolchains.json)
- Subagent context injection (SubagentStart → repo CLAUDE.md + budget visibility)
- Post-tool-use audit (session stats tracking for cost optimization)
- Hook utilities library (fail-open, block, warn, dedup, identity, facts)
- Session counters (threshold-based hook behavior)
- Maintainer permissions model (global + per-repo scopes, hard-block config)
- Secret pattern scanning (8 patterns: GitHub PAT, AWS, Anthropic, etc.)
- Direct-to-main push for logs/notes (worktree-based, no PR friction)
- Cost optimization: subagent model routing, max_turns per type, budget visibility, facts cache

## Contamination Audit — PASSED

Full audit found 7 instances of project-specific material. All fixed in commit `06e1b31`:
1. "twyne-root" provenance comments in pre-edit-guard.sh and hook-utils.sh
2. Hardcoded `/mnt/raid0/` paths in check_filesystem_path.sh
3. `llama-server` + 200GB threshold in inference_guard.sh and run_wrapper.sh
4. `orchestrator llama` example in add-dependency.sh
5. Qwen3-8B / Q4_K_M / inference_endpoint examples in swarm/README.md

Post-fix verification: `grep -ri 'epyc\|twyne\|llama\|Qwen\|Q4_K\|orchestrator\|/mnt/raid0'` returns zero matches.

## Remaining Work

See GitHub issues for detailed checklists. Key gaps:
- No tests yet for swarm coordinator
- Nightshift worker launch is stubbed (needs Claude Code session spawning)
- AutoPilot integration is design-only (issue #3)
- Some twyne-root patterns still TODO: devcontainer setup, plan persistence hook, progress report auto-generation

## Next Session

Continue work directly in `/mnt/raid0/llm/root-archetype` — the repo is self-governing with its own `.claude/` config. Use GitHub issues #1-#4 as the backlog.
